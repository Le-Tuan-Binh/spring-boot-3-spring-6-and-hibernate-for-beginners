## Spring Boot and Spring for Beginners

**Spring** is a comprehensive framework for building Java applications, offering features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and robust support for enterprise technologies such as JDBC, JPA, and more.

It provides a modular approach to building applications, encouraging best practices and design patterns that promote maintainability and scalability.

**Spring Boot** on the other hand, is built on top of Spring and aims to simplify the development process by providing a set of conventions and pre-configurations.

It eliminates much of the boilerplate configuration that developers would typically need to set up a Spring application, such as configuring dependencies, setting up servers, and defining application contexts.
