## Hibernate and JPA Overview

### 1. What is Hibernate ?

**Hibernate** is a framework for **persisting** or **saving** Java objecs in a database. You can go to the [Hibernate ORM](https://hibernate.org/orm/) to see more detail about this.

This is a very popular framework that used by a lot of enterprise Java projects. Basic in a high level of design you can see the image below

The Hibernate will alternative replace for the **ORM Framework**.

The java application will make use of this Hibernate framework and you can use it for saving and retrieving data from the database.

### 2. Benefit of Hibernate ?

Hibernate handles all of the low-level SQL, it minimizes the amount of JDBC code you have to develop.

**Hibernate** provides the **Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)** and it make it really easy to create apps to store and retrieve objects from the database.

### 3. Object To Relation Mapping (ORM)

Hibernate provide something called the Object to Relational Mapping or you will hear the buzzword or keyword call ORM. 

The developer defines mapping betwwen Java class and database table.

And all we will need to do here is that this Java class will map to this given table. And we set up the **one-to-one** mapping between the fields and the actual columns in the database.

You can set up this mapping by using the **XML**, or using **Java Annotation**.
